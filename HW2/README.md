Homework2
We as a group 22, Ulviyya Jafarli, Batuhan Yeniceri and Stefano Verrecchia did this homework 2 together. 
Stefano Verrecchia worked on Research question 3 and Core question 1;
Batuhan Yeniceri worked on Research question 1 and 2 and Core question 2;
Ulviyya Jafarli worked on Research question 4 and 5, theoretical question and Core question 2;

We combined all questions with given order in two different files. One is main.py written in spider and the other is main.ipynb in jupiter. We did it that way because in py file we could not show the plots so we also added same codes but in jupiter. According to question number we named variables with _RQn and _CQn_P1 or _CQn_P2 in main.py but in main.ipynb we did not change names, in some questions you can see same names.

We add theoretical question in theoretical.py.
